# POS Operations

The POS screen is the primary interface for taking orders and processing payments.

## Taking Orders

### Browsing the Menu

The POS screen displays menu categories as tabs along the top. Tap a category to see its items. Each item shows its name, price, and availability status.

### Adding Items to Cart

- **Tap an item** to add one to the cart
- If the item has **modifier groups**, a modal appears for customization
- **Quantity controls** (+/-) in the cart adjust amounts
- **Notes**: Tap a cart item to add special instructions (e.g., "extra spicy", "no cilantro")

### Modifiers

When an item has attached modifier groups:

1. Required groups must have a selection before continuing
2. Optional groups can be skipped
3. Each modifier option can have a **price adjustment** (positive or negative)
4. Multiple selections may be allowed depending on the group config

### Combos

Combo items appear in the menu alongside regular items:

1. Tap a combo to start building it
2. Fill each **slot** (e.g., choose a main, a side, a drink)
3. Each slot restricts choices to specific categories or items
4. The combo has a fixed price regardless of individual item prices

## Delivery Alert Banner

When delivery platforms (Uber Eats, Rappi, DiDi Food) are connected, the POS screen shows a live alert banner for incoming delivery orders. This ensures cashiers and staff are aware of active delivery orders without needing to navigate away from the POS.

### How It Works

- A colored banner appears at the top of the POS screen for each active delivery order
- **Platform-specific colors** make it easy to identify the source at a glance:
  - **Green**: Uber Eats
  - **Orange**: Rappi
  - **Amber**: DiDi Food
- Each alert shows the **platform name**, **order number**, **customer name**, **total**, and a **live elapsed timer**
- Orders older than **10 minutes** display a red pulsing timer to flag urgency
- Tap the **X** button to dismiss an alert (it reappears on page refresh so nothing is missed)
- The banner updates automatically every 20 seconds

:::tip
The delivery alert banner works on both the web POS and the Android POS app. No extra setup is needed — if delivery platforms are connected, alerts appear automatically.

## Offline Mode

The POS continues to work when internet is unavailable:

- Menu data is cached locally via IndexedDB
- **Cash orders** can be created offline with `OFF-NNN` numbering
- Orders queue locally and **sync automatically** when connectivity returns
- Card payments require an internet connection

:::caution
Offline orders are cash-only. Card payments cannot be processed without an internet connection.
