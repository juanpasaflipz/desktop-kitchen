      text: "When you hear \"artificial intelligence in restaurants,\" you probably think of robots flipping burgers or sci-fi systems. The reality is much more practical and accessible. The AI that is actually changing kitchen operations in Mexico is not flashy: it is a system that analyzes your sales data, detects patterns you cannot see, and tells you exactly what to do to sell more and waste less. At Desktop Kitchen, we have been integrating these capabilities for months and the results speak for themselves.",

Desktop Kitchen's AI analyzes the actual purchase patterns of your business -- not assumptions, but data -- and suggests the add-on that statistically has the highest probability of acceptance based on what the customer already has in their order.",

      text: "For example, if your data shows that 40% of customers who order tacos al pastor also order horchata water, the system automatically suggests the cashier offer the horchata. But if the customer ordered a milanesa torta, maybe the data says the most popular add-on is a grapefruit soda. Each suggestion is specific to your business, not a generic recommendation.",

    {

      text: "Pricing in most restaurants is based on intuition: \"I feel like this dish is too cheap\" or \"the competition charges more.\" Desktop Kitchen's AI analyzes the real elasticity of each product -- what happens to sales when you raise or lower the price -- and suggests specific adjustments. If a product sells the same at $85 as at $95, you are leaving $10 per sale on the table. If another product drops dramatically when going from $60 to $70, the AI alerts you before you lose volume.",

    {
      type: "paragraph",

A 5% shrinkage rate may seem small, but in a business that brings in $300,000 MXN per month, that is $15,000 literally going in the trash. Desktop Kitchen's AI compares your theoretical inventory (what you should have based on sales) against your physical inventory (what you actually have) and detects discrepancies that indicate waste, theft, or portioning errors.",

With that information, you can investigate and correct quickly instead of discovering it at month-end when it is too late.",
