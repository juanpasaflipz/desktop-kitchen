But if you are using a traditional POS, that same system that should be helping you is probably holding you back. Expensive hardware that breaks down, updates that never arrive, zero delivery integration, basic reports that tell you nothing useful. And in the meantime, you are paying annual licenses for a system stuck in 2015.",

What they did not tell you is everything you would spend afterward: repairs when the terminal freezes, paid updates that come once a year (if they come at all), a technician who has to physically visit every time something fails, and the impossibility of adding features that are now basic -- like Uber Eats integration.",
