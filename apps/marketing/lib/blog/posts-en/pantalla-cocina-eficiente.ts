The result is forgotten orders, duplicated dishes, frustrated customers, and lost revenue. The Kitchen Display System, or KDS, is the solution to a problem that has plagued restaurants for decades.",

      text: "Paper tickets seem to work fine until they do not. During a rush hour with 30 simultaneous orders, the margin for error is enormous. Tickets pile up, get out of order, the ink fades from heat, and nobody knows for sure which order should go out first. If you are also handling delivery orders alongside dine-in, the chaos multiplies. Tickets fall or get wet, thermal printer text becomes illegible, orders get prepared out of sequence, modifications are not communicated properly, and there is zero history once the ticket hits the trash.",

      text: "A KDS replaces the ticket printer with a digital screen in the kitchen. When an order is entered into the POS -- whether from the cashier, a delivery platform, or an online order -- it automatically appears on the kitchen display with all the necessary information: items, modifications, elapsed time, and priority. The cook marks each dish as ready and the system updates the order status in real time.",

This allows the kitchen team to prioritize without a manager hovering over every dish.",
