You track everything in a notebook or a spreadsheet that nobody updates. And at the end of the month, waste eats into your profits without you being able to explain exactly where the money went. Artificial intelligence is radically changing this reality.",

With that data, it generates predictions of how much you will sell of each dish over the coming days. If rainy Fridays boost your soup sales by 40%, the system knows and alerts you in advance.",
