If tomorrow Uber Eats changes its algorithm or raises its commissions, your sales can drop overnight. The solution is not to abandon the platforms, but to use smart strategies to convert those customers into direct, repeat buyers.",

You do not have their phone number, you do not have their email, you do not know how many times they have ordered or what they liked most. If that customer stops ordering, you have no way to reach them. You are paying 25% to 35% in commission per order, and on top of that, you are building someone else's customer base.",
